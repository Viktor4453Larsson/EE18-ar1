        Four images of the moon's surface

        Historical Date: February 20, 1965</p>
        <p>Final pictures taken by the Ranger 8 P-camera about 1/2 second before impact. Impact occurred on 20 February 1965 at 9:57:36.256 UT. The images are ordered (clockwise from upper left) P3, P4, P2, P1. Impact occurred before transmission of the image P4 was complete, hence the static over most of the image. The areas shown are in Mare Tranquillitatus (Sea of Tranquillity) about 60 km north of the Apollo 11 landing site. Image P3 was taken 0.489 seconds before impact, from a distance of 1.09 km. The image is about 140 meters across. Image P1 was taken 0.689 seconds before impact from 1.52 km and is 60 meters across. Image P2 was taken 0.289 seconds prior to impact from 640 meters. The frame is 30 meters across. North is up on all images. (Ranger 8, P020)

        <p>This photograph of astronaut Neil A. Armstrong, Apollo 11 commander, was taken inside the Lunar Module (LM) while the LM rested on the lunar surface. Astronauts Armstrong and Edwin E. Aldrin Jr., lunar module pilot, had already completed their historic extravehicular activity (EVA) when this picture was made. Astronaut Michael Collins, command module pilot, remained with the Command and Service Modules (CSM) in lunar orbit while Armstrong and Aldrin explored the Moon's surface.</p>

        <p>Get out your red/blue anaglyph glasses for a three-dimensional treat. This extreme closeup of the south edge of the Moon's famous Tycho Crater shows melt flows and pools, small craters, sagging slopes that look like ripples, boulders, and part of the crater rim. North is at the top. Image width is about six miles (10 kilometers).</p>
        <p>Pairs of images from NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter were combined to create the 3D view.</p>

        <p>Eimmart A, at 4.5 miles (7.3 kilometers) wide, is not large as lunar impact craters go, but its youth and location combine to make it spectacular. Because it is young — excavated by an asteroid or comet impact in the late Copernican, probably less than 100 million years ago — its rim is sharp, its impact melt flows and ponds are obvious, and the boulders strewn over the surface around it are prominent.</p>
        <p>When it comes to rock types, the real estate mantra "location, location, location" applies to Eimmart A. The crater, located at 24.12ºN, 65.62ºE, sits on the rim of 25-mile-wide (40-kilometer-wide) Eimmart crater, which is in 93-mile-long (150-kilometer-long) Mare Anguis (the Serpent Sea), which in turn overlies ejecta from the 345-mile-wide (555-kilometer-wide) Mare Crisium impact basin. This means that dark rocks that occur mainly on the east side of Eimmart A are Mare Anguis basalts, while lighter Crisium rocks make up the west side.</p>
        <p>Eimmart A is "two-faced" in other ways. The south and east flanks include many boulders, but melt deposits are small. The north and west flanks include some boulders, but a pair of three-kilometer-long melt flows dominate these areas. The south interior wall includes large outcrops: one triangular outcrop, 600 meters long, is the largest of any found on the Moon in a crater in Eimmart A's size range. The north, east, and west walls have smaller outcrops or none at all. What makes them so different?</p>
        <p>This image comes from the LROC camera aboard NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter.</p>
